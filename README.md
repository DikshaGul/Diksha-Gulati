**SeeColors**

SeeColors is a Python-based project where I explore how to extract and understand colors from images.
The project focuses on reading pixel-level RGB values from images and converting them into meaningful, human-readable color names.
Over time, it is being extended to analyze dominant colors in an image and work towards better color accessibility.

This project is part of my learning journey in Python, image processing, and practical problem-solving.

**What the Project Does**

Takes an image as input from the user

Extracts RGB values from selected pixels

Allows interactive selection of pixels by clicking on the image

Identifies the closest matching color name for given RGB values

Extracts dominant colors present in the image

Maps dominant colors to readable color names for better understanding

**Current Progress**

Successfully loaded user-uploaded images and displayed them

Extracted pixel-level RGB values from images

Implemented click-based color detection instead of fixed pixel coordinates

Handled images with transparency (RGBA → RGB conversion)

Mapped RGB values to the closest CSS3 color names

Extracted dominant colors from images and identified their names

Started aligning the project towards color accessibility use cases

**Tech Stack Used**
